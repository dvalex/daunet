# This is a callback function to be used with training of Keras models.
# It create an exponential moving average of a model (trainable) weights.
# This functionlity is already available in TensorFlow:
# https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/api_docs/python/train.html#ExponentialMovingAverage
# and can often be used to get better validation/test performance. For an
# intuitive explantion on why to use this, see 'Model Ensembles" section here:
